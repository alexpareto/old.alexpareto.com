My personal website, mainly a place for me to share my past and present projects. [Check it out](http://alexpareto.com).

## Implementation and Other Notes

The site is built mainly on CSS and HTML with a dash of JavaScript to preload icons and change the sidebar color on click. Uses [Skeleton](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton/) for responsiveness.

Fonts: Scope One and Raleway.
Sidebar Colors: #9ad3de, #89bdd3, #dbe9d8, #b0aac2, #dbc3d0, and #4D7EA8.

The social icons were designed by [Alexis Doreau](https://dribbble.com/alexisdoreau).
